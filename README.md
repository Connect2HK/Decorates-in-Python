*************decorators**************************

What are decorators?

Decorators allow you to wrap existing functions or classes with additional functionality. They provide a way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or classes at runtime, without modifying their original implementation.

How do decorators work?

Decorators are implemented as functions themselves, taking the function or class they decorate as an input and returning a new modified version. They are applied using the @ symbol, just above the function or class definition.
